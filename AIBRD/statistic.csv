docker,11180,Warning: Mounting volumes containing files downloaded with Safari in OS X,,0,0,0,0

docker,15997,Docker volume can keep track of volumes in a number of ways;,,0,0,0,0
docker,15997,"- Volumes created with the 'local' driver are stored inside `/var/lib/docker`, and can be resolved through the filesystem",,0,0,0,0
